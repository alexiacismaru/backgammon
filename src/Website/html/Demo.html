            The aim of the game is to move all of your pawns to your side of the board and remove all of you opponent's pawns from and table.<br>
            This game is inspired by the ancient game of BACKGAMMON, which is a two-player game where each player has fifteen pieces that move<br>
            between twenty-four triangles according to the roll of two dice. Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck. With each<br>
            roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their pieces and anticipate possible counter-moves by the
            opponent.
